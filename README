Object Literal Manipulator function.
This is a very simple class that can be usefull tool if you like Object Literal Pattern.
This tool is composed of few methods and these methods should suffice for manipulating literals.

This library is distributed under the MIT license.

Every function in olit.js is documented and has the example so it's the best source of documentation.
Tests are written in jasmine so their are self explanatory. You can use them as a tutorial.
However i'm pasting here a simple usage example:

var obj = {foo: 'bar'};
var obj1 = olit(obj).clone().get();

obj1.foo = 'baz';

obj1 == obj;
//returns: false

obj1 = olit(obj1).extend({hello: 'World'}).get();
obj1.hello;
//returns: 'World'


var Klass = olit(obj1).makeClass(function () {}
    this.foo = 'TEST';
).get();

var a = new Klass();
a.foo == 'TEST';
//returns: true
a.hello == 'World';
//returns: true
